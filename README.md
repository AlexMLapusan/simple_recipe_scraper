## Simple recipe scraper script  
The config file contains the only two necessary parameters.  
The output path must contain the name of the csv we want to create.  
Run the script as you would run any python script:  
python3 main.py  
  
Install all necessary dependencies (most importantly: pip install recipe_scrapers)
